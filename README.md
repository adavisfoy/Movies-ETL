# Amazing Prime Movies - Extract, Transform, Load

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing database tables in PostgreSQL for a fictional hackathon. We accomplished this by refactoring previous code into one function that ingests three files (Wikipedia data [JSON], Kaggle metadata [CSV], and the MovieLens rating data [CSV]) and then performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

## Amazing Prime Movies - ETL Deliverables
This challenge involved four technical analysis deliverables:
- Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
- Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
- Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
- Deliverable 4: Load/Create the Movie Database
